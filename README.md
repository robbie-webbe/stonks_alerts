# STONKS Alert System for XMM-Newton Analysis

This github will host the STONKS alerts associated with observations performed for the Multi-Year Heritage Programs currently active. There are two MYHPs currently active, 
but at present we only focus on observations taken as part of the Ponti Galactic Plane survey. We focus further on only those observations from 01/07/2023 onwards as those which
would ordinarily still be covered by a proprietary period.




## Results Summary


Observations for the period from 01/07/2023 - present

No. observations with alerts (total observations) :		27  (84)

No. true object alerts (total alerts):   24  (56)
