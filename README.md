# STONKS Alert System for XMM-Newton Analysis

This github will host analyses of the STONKS alerts associated with observations performed for the two XMM-Nweton Multi-Year Heritage Programs which are currently active. The first of the MYHPs focuses on the Galactic Plane, and is nearing completion with a small number of observations still to be performed as of 01/08/2024. The second MYHP focuses on extra-galactic sources and had not begun observing as of 01/07/2024. 

We focus initially on the MYHPs as they allow for data to be public far sooner than regular observing cycles. As such, a timely analysis will allow for fast follow-up of alerts of interest in a much faster fashion and could allow for the identification of new medium-term transient sources which could still be evolving. All details of the analysis and sources of interest will be listed in the wiki pages for this git.

The initial analysis focused on all alerts obtained between 01/07/2023 and 30/06/2024, and demonstrated there was significant potential for the detection of new sources.

The secondary analysis will focus in greater detail on all alerts from the first completed MYHP.
